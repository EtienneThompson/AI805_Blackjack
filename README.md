**Running the code:**

To run the code, run the command:

```bash
python3 blackjack.py
```

It will prompt if you want to run the project in debug mode or simulation mode.

Debug mode runs the series of games, but allows for user interaction to step through the code. It also will output extra logs into the console.

Simulation mode will quickly run through 100 iterations of the game, without waiting for user input, and will output less information to the console.
